## History

Growing up in Adelaide, South Australia. Ben began his life as a normal child, with all the prospects of becoming a contributing member of society.

However during his schooling he discovered the internet, which corrupted his fragile mind.

After spending thousands of hours on the web, he was unable to function normally without seeing meme's everywhere.

## Now

Why would you still be reading this, he's unwell, there's nothing to see here.
