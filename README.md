# My Portfolio Site!

## Motivation
My motivation for writing my personal site was to have a good place for people to get in touch with me after giving talks. Also, I don't get many excuses to write static sites so this was **so** much fun!

## Code Style
I stick to standard.js for JavaScript

## Features
All of the CSS! I challenged myself to not use a framework and there's flexbox, animations, pseudoclasses, parallax, canvas, etc.! It was definitely a challenge to get everything looking great!

## Stack
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
    * P5JS for the dynamic random shapes!

## Deployment
Site is deployed at https://aspittel.github.io.

## Local Installation
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/aspittel/aspittel.github.io/
$ hs
```
